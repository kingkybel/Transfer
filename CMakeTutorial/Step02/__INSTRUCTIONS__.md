# Better structure
In C++ we often use very many files that make up our project. Often we produce many libraries and different
executables, configurations, containers etc. It is vital that we structure our projects appropriately.

In order to impose a better structure on the project the following was done:
- created a subfolder called "include/" to contain header (*.h) files
- created a subfolder called "src/" to contain C++ - implementation files (*.cc or *.cpp or *.cxx)
- created a source and header pair that implements a function include/greeter.h and src/greeter.cc
- moved the main file step2.cc into the src/ folder

So Let's try to build without modifying the CMakeLists.txt:

00) create a build directory and change to the directory `mkdir -p ./build ; cd build`
03) cmake ..
02) observe: cmake files and folders are created and not cluttering project directory
03) make
04) observe: build `fails` with "Step02/src/step2.cc:1:10: fatal error: greeter.h: No such file or directory"

# What happened?
The pre-processor tries to do its job and replace the #include instruction in line 1 of the file step2.cc
with the contents of the file `greeter.h` - but the file cannot found.
By default the compiler looks only in the local directory and in system-folders like `/usr/include` for header files.

# How do we fix it?
We have to tell cmake where to find header files.

10) open the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the project folder for editing
11) at the very end of the file add the following lines and save the file
```
include_directories(
  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include
  )
```
_NOTE_: The variable `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` in the above segment is a cmake variable that is set to the location 
        of the current CMakeLists.txt
12) in the build directory try `make` again
13) observe: the build fails again, but with a different error:
```
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/step1.dir/src/step2.cc.o: in function `main':
step2.cc:(.text+0x9): undefined reference to `sayHello()'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/step1.dir/build.make:97: step1] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:83: CMakeFiles/step1.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [Makefile:91: all] Error 2
```

# What the heck?
Now our program passes the pre-processor stage, which means now the header file is found and pre-processed.
The compilation also succeeds - I know this because I did not get a syntax error.
However - the linker fails with an undefined symbol/reference.
We declared the function `sayHello()` in the header file `include/greeter.h` and defined (implemented) in
`src/greeter.cc`.
**However we failed tell cmake, that this file also needs to be compiled.**

# Make it work
20) open the CMakeLists.txt file in the project folder for editing
21) edit the line
```
add_executable(step2 src/step2.cc)
```
to also include the greeter - source
```
add_executable(step2 src/step2.cc src/greeter.cc)
```
23) do `make` again
24) observe: the build now works and the executable is created
25) ./step2  # should show the "Hello World" message

# If you want to try this again then
30) cd CMakeTutorial/Step02
31) rm -rf build
32) cp CMakeLists-backup.txt CMakeLists.txt
